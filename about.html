<div class="abouttwo">
<p>redshft magazine's main goal is to create content that is relatable to a wide audience. Interviews with people who are still in school or at the very start of their career. Interviews that don't only focus on what work a person is making but also how their personal life impacts their work. Whether it be school,work,relationships, etc. As most people know actually creating work is only half the battle, redshft wants to showcase the other half.  </p>
